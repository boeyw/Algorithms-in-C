# Algorithms-in-C
Algorithms should not be restricted to a single programming language. Psedu code might be the best way to represent  algorithms, but they are not runable. Then C might be the second suitable language to describe algorithms because there are minimum syntaxes that are easy to understand.

Currently, this project is concentrating on writing sorting algorithms. So you are definitely welcome to contribute!

## TODO
- [Cube Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubesort): need time
